I completed the following optional tasks:

- Creating the necessary table in order to store charts in the database- a table called charts, his only column contains a list of itegers which represent the albums id. This way, multiple lists of albums (in a specific order) are held by the table.

- Creating an object-oriented model of the data managed by the Java application, having the classes Artist, Album, Chart.

- Generating random artists and albums and creating the methods used for inserting them into the database

- Displaying the rank of the artists, considering their positions in the charts. Everytime a chart is created, a certain value is added to the artist's rank, depending on the position their albums have in the chart.

See the output8.jpg image in order to see the random generated data and the rank the artists have.
See the chartsTable.jpg in order to see a random example that shows the way the chart table looks like
